          Your smileâ€™s a sunrise, warm and bright,<br>
          your laughâ€™s a song in soft daylight.<br>
          Your eyes, they hold a gentle gleam,<br>
          like hopeful stars within a dream.<br>
          The way you hold my hand with care,<br>
          and brush the strands of my loose hair,<br>
          it feels like home, it feels so rightâ€”<br>
          so safe in your warmth, so soft in your light.

          To my dearest darling,<br><br>
              I donâ€™t even know how to start this without smiling because just thinking about you already fills me up in ways I canâ€™t explain. Youâ€™ve become such a special part of my life that even the simplest moments with you feel extraordinary. Sometimes, itâ€™s the way you laugh at the tiniest things, or how you listen so intently even when Iâ€™m talking about random stuff. Sometimes, itâ€™s how you always make me feel like I matterâ€”like Iâ€™m seen and heard even when I canâ€™t find the right words to explain how I feel.<br><br>
              I cherish every bit of you. Every little thing you do feels so important to me, even the things you might not even notice about yourself. Like how you stay up late just to check if I got home safe, or how you can sense when Iâ€™m not okay even when I say Iâ€™m fine. You make me feel safe, like I can breathe easier knowing youâ€™re there, even if weâ€™re not in the same place. Youâ€™ve become my calm in the middle of chaos, my safe place to land when everything feels heavy.<br><br>
              And honestly, baby, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever felt this kind of love before. Itâ€™s warm and real and a little overwhelming sometimes, but in the best way possible. Youâ€™ve shown me patience when Iâ€™m at my worst and kindness when I canâ€™t seem to be kind to myself. Even when I mess up or when I struggle to express my feelings properly, you still choose to stayâ€”you still choose me. Thatâ€™s something Iâ€™ll never take for granted, because people like youâ€¦ they donâ€™t just come around every day.<br><br>
              Sometimes I wonder what I did to deserve someone like you. You make me feel so blessed, so loved, so incredibly lucky. And because of that, I want to keep choosing you too. I want to love you back the way you deserveâ€”to hold your hand through good days and bad, to stand beside you when things get hard, and to remind you that youâ€™ll never have to go through life alone as long as Iâ€™m here.<br><br>
              So before I overthink and rewrite this a hundred times (kasi I already did), I just want to say thisâ€”I love you. I really, really do. Thank you for being patient with me, for caring for me, for making me laugh, and for just being you. And if itâ€™s okay with you, Iâ€™d like to keep calling you mine. Actuallyâ€”scratch thatâ€”Iâ€™d like to be yours officially.<br><br>
              - Your girlfriend !
